# React + Vite
Making a Todo list using React and Vite

Your todo list application must have:

A heading labeling it as a "todo list."
A list of "todo" items, which are strings listing activities to be accomplished (e.g. "find that missing sock"). Each "todo" item should have:

A checkbox next to it which indicates whether it is "complete."
A "delete" button next to it which removes it from the list.

The "delete" button should be disabled unless the todo is complete!
An "edit" button that replaces the todo string with a text input used to edit the todo.

Hint: bind the value of this text input to a piece of state so that it is always accurate, even when first displayed!
When this text input is active, the "delete" and "edit" buttons should be hidden, and a "save" button should appear. The "save" button should save any changes made to the todo within the text input.
An input element that creates new todo items and adds them to the list.
New todos should be added to the top of the list visually; the oldest todos should be at the bottom.
Here is a simple example of what your application might look like upon completion:
